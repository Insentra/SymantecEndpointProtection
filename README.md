# Symantec Endpoint Protection

Using the Symantec Endpoint Protection REST API to manage a SEP environment. Documentation for the REST API is available here: [https://apidocs.symantec.com/home/saep](https://apidocs.symantec.com/home/saep).

Need to determine the APIs to target for reading / writing in a SEP environment. This approach could be used to read from a SEP environment for health checks or documentation.
